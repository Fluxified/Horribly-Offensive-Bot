OW Account Library:
- Library # This should show a list of accounts which are registered and their current ranks.
  /library -> Returns a list of registered accounts (AccountID, Status, RankTank, RankDamage, RankSupport, RankOpen, Owner)
  # Accounts are added directly to the database by Flux :)
  # AccountID is the Battle Tag of the account
  # Status is if the account is checked out or not
  # Rank x3
  # Rank for OpenQueue
  # Owner so the person checking out the account can contact the owner if the account needs authentication
- Checkout # This should allow a user to check out an account and mark the account as in-use or active (Default return time is 5hrs).
  /checkout {accountID} -> Returns the login info for the specified account if the user has permission
  # Should prompt the user in a ghost message so only they can see it.
  # Should also provide information for returning the bot and how much time they have.
  # Should only allow one account to be checked out at a time.
  # Should promot the user if they run out of time. If they are still using the account then they should /checkout again
- Return # This should allow a user to return an account early.
  /return -> Prompts the user with the account has been returned and that they can check out another account if they want
  # Should know the user and which account was returned.
  # If the user uses the command and doesn't have a bot checked out then return nothing was returned.
